Cognitive Level: {level}
- L1 (Recall): Direct facts, must be factually accurate
- L2 (Multi-Source Synthesis): Combining information from multiple sources
- L3 (Temporal Reasoning): Understanding changes over time, computing differences
- L4 (Procedural Learning): Learning and applying step-by-step procedures
- L5 (Contradiction Handling): Detecting and reasoning about conflicting information
- L6 (Incremental Learning): Updating knowledge when new information arrives

Question: {question}

Expected Answer: {expected}

Agent's Answer: {actual}

Grade the agent's answer on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0:
- 1.0: Perfect match or semantically equivalent
- 0.8-0.9: Correct main points, minor differences
- 0.6-0.7: Partially correct, missing some details
- 0.4-0.5: Some relevant content, significant gaps
- 0.0-0.3: Incorrect or unrelated

Special considerations:
- L5 (Contradictions): Award full points if agent acknowledges the contradiction, even if they don't resolve it
- L6 (Updates): Agent must use the MOST RECENT information, not outdated data
- L7 (Teaching): Grade based on factual accuracy of the answer, regardless of how it was learned
- L9 (Causal): When asking about "most important single factor" or "root cause", accept
  EITHER "program restructuring after 2018" OR "winning the hosting bid" as valid root causes.
  Both are defensible interpretations. Score 0.8+ if the agent picks either and provides
  sound causal reasoning explaining why that factor is the root cause.
- L11 (Novel Skill): For workflow/config generation, grade on correctness of REQUIRED fields.
  Do NOT penalize for including extra optional fields if the required ones are correct.
- L12 (Far Transfer): When computing ratios and trends, the DIRECTION of the trend
  (improving vs worsening) is critical. Correct ratio computation with wrong trend
  direction should score 0.5-0.6, not 0.8+.
- IMPORTANT: If the agent shows work/reasoning, look at the FINAL CONCLUSION,
  not just the opening line. Agents may self-correct during reasoning.
  The final answer at the end of the response is what matters.
