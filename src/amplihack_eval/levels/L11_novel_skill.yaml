questions:
  - id: L11_Q01
    text: "What is the fundamental difference between a GitHub Agentic Workflow and a traditional GitHub Actions workflow?"
    expected_answer: "Agentic workflows use natural language markdown instructions interpreted by an AI engine, while traditional Actions use YAML-based conditional logic. Agentic workflows have built-in security controls (read-only defaults, safe outputs, sandboxing) and can reason about context."

    text: "Write a complete gh-aw workflow file that triggers when a new issue is opened, uses Claude as the AI engine, has bash access (only git and echo), and can create comments and add labels."

    text: "A developer wants their gh-aw workflow to directly write files during the agent execution step. Explain why this is not possible and what to use instead."
    expected_answer: "The agent job runs with read-only permissions by default. Direct writes are prevented because the agent could be compromised via prompt injection. Instead, use safe outputs (like create-pull-request) which buffer output to an artifact, run a detection job to scan for malicious content, then execute the write in a separate permission-scoped job."

    text: "Teach a junior developer how to create their first gh-aw workflow in 5 steps. Include the most common beginner mistake."
    expected_answer: "1. Create .github/workflows/my-workflow.md with YAML frontmatter and markdown body. 2. Run `gh aw compile` to generate .lock.yml. 3. Commit both .md and .lock.yml files. 4. Push to trigger, or `gh aw run my-workflow`. 5. Check the Actions tab for results. Common mistake: Editing frontmatter without recompiling."
