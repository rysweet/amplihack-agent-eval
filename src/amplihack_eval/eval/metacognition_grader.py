"""Metacognition grader with 4-dimension scoring.

Evaluates student learning across four metacognitive dimensions:
1. Factual Accuracy - Are the facts correct?
2. Self-Awareness - Does the student know what it knows/doesn't know?
3. Knowledge Boundaries - Can the student identify gaps?
4. Explanation Quality - Are self-explanations coherent and insightful?

Philosophy:
- Single responsibility: Grade metacognition only
- LLM-powered evaluation via SDK adapter
- Structured JSON output for reliable parsing
- Graceful degradation on errors
